Memory-Colour
=============

A little hobby project.

This is a Hybrid mobile application using Cordova library & Javascript. I am only at the moment developing for the iOS environment.

What does this little game do?:
    This is a memory game. The computer chooses a new colour each round, and the user must click/touch the same colour. As the      rounds increase, so does the number of colours. The colours MUST be picked in the same order as the computer shows.
